## Login - Sign up

This implementation allows users to register and log in while ensuring data validation, unique email registration, and secure authentication handling.

Features
âœ… Unique Email Validation â€“ A user cannot register with an already registered email.
âœ… Secure Login â€“ Displays a generic "Invalid Credentials" error to prevent email enumeration.
âœ… Form Validation â€“ Ensures correct email format and minimum password length.

## Guards

The application restricts access based on user authentication status:

ðŸ”’ Auth Guard (authGuard) â€“ Ensures only authenticated users can access protected routes like /events. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page (/auth).
ðŸš« Login Guard (loginGuard) â€“ Prevents logged-in users from accessing the login page. If already logged in, users are redirected to /events.

## Event Management

The event listing page (/events) allows users to view, edit, and delete events with pagination persistence.

Event Listing Features
âœ… Pagination Persistence â€“ Maintains the current page and items per page when navigating away and back.
âœ… Event Management Actions â€“ Users can view, edit, and delete events.
âœ… Date Formatting â€“ Displays event dates in a user-friendly format.

Technical Details

Uses Angular Material Table (MatTableDataSource) for listing events.
Stores paginator state (pageIndex, pageSize) in a service to persist pagination state across navigations.
Uses MatPaginator with \_changePageSize() to maintain pagination settings when returning to the event list.
