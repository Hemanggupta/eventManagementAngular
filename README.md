## Login - Sign up

This implementation allows users to register and log in while ensuring data validation, unique email registration, and secure authentication handling.

Features
✅ Unique Email Validation – A user cannot register with an already registered email.
✅ Secure Login – Displays a generic "Invalid Credentials" error to prevent email enumeration.
✅ Form Validation – Ensures correct email format and minimum password length.

## Guards

The application restricts access based on user authentication status:

🔒 Auth Guard (authGuard) – Ensures only authenticated users can access protected routes like /events. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page (/auth).
🚫 Login Guard (loginGuard) – Prevents logged-in users from accessing the login page. If already logged in, users are redirected to /events.
